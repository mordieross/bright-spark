This is a Rails & React web application for generating questions for the transfer test formally known as the 11+ in the UK.

It's intended to help pupils study to get access to grammar schools. 

We hope to release this soon free of charge to anyone interested in using it for practicing for the exams.

Front end is currently under construction.

Maths questions are written in ruby and generated randomly.

English question generation will be implemented soon using NLP and simple algorithms to select random questions from a db.

This is free to use but carries no guarantees for fitness of purpose etc.

See the license for more info.
